# Japanese Match Maker

Deconstructs Japanese sentences composed of standard ruby html markup, creating a playable "Match Maker" game.  The player drags the kanji characters into the correct location slots within the sentence.

## How to Play

1. Generate standard ruby html mark Using my sibling tool [Japanese Furigana Generator](https://github.com/christopherball/japaneseFuriganaGenerator).
2. Paste said markup into the input for this tool.
3. Play (and hopefully have more fun learning)!
